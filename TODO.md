  * We could coalesce adjacent free blocks
  * Create a standalone implementation of malloc() and friends using smart\_alloc
  * smart\_alloc\_info - Returns allocation information
  * smart\_alloc\_options - Where to get memory from, whether or not to zero/randomize memory post-free
  * What license should this be under?
  * Be able to give memory back if we can
  * Optionally run tests in a child process
